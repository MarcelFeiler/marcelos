# Hey!
👋 I'm Marcel, a final-year Information Technology student at Brno University of Technology.

🎓 Possessing a comprehensive command of programming languages such as C, PHP (with specialization in the Laravel framework), Python, alongside adeptness in database management using MySQL, and proficiency in shell scripting with bash, I have cultivated a robust foundation in computer science. Moreover, I am adept in crafting compelling web interfaces using HTML and CSS.
I'm always curious about learning and exploring new areas in IT.
